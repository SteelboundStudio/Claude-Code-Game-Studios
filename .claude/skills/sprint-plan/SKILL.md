## Phase 0: Parse Arguments

Extract the mode argument (`new`, `update`, or `status`) and resolve the review mode (once, store for all gate spawns this run):
1. If `--review [full|lean|solo]` was passed → use that
2. Else read `production/review-mode.txt` → use that value
3. Else → default to `lean`

See `.claude/docs/director-gates.md` for the full check pattern.

**Review mode check** (before gates run):
- Read `production/review-mode.txt` if it exists. Use that mode.
- If the file doesn't exist: default to `lean`, write `production/review-mode.txt`
  with `lean`, and say: "No review mode set — defaulting to lean and saved to
  production/review-mode.txt. Override per-run with `--review full|lean|solo`."
  (Replacement check: review-mode.txt resolves to a valid value. This sets review
  DEPTH only — it does not skip the verification gates that run within the chosen
  mode.)

---

## Phase 1: Gather Context

1. **Read the current milestone** from `production/milestones/`.

2. **Read the previous sprint** (if any) from `production/sprints/` to
   understand velocity and carryover.

3. **Scan design documents** in `design/gdd/` for features tagged as ready
   for implementation.

4. **Check the risk register** at `production/risk-register/`.

---

## Phase 2: Generate Output

For `new`:

**Generate a sprint plan** following this format and present it to the user. Do NOT ask to write yet — the producer feasibility gate (Phase 4) runs first and may require revisions before the file is written.

```markdown
# Sprint [N] — [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Sprint Goal
[One sentence describing what this sprint achieves toward the milestone]

## Capacity
- Total days: [X]
- Buffer (20%): [Y days reserved for unplanned work]
- Available: [Z days]

## Tasks

### Must Have (Critical Path)
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

### Should Have
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

### Nice to Have
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

## Carryover from Previous Sprint
| Task | Reason | New Estimate |
|------|--------|-------------|

## Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|

## Dependencies on External Factors
- [List any external dependencies]

## Definition of Done for this Sprint
- [ ] All Must Have tasks completed
- [ ] All tasks pass acceptance criteria
- [ ] QA plan exists (`production/qa/qa-plan-sprint-[N].md`)
- [ ] All Logic/Integration stories have passing unit/integration tests
- [ ] Smoke check passed (`/smoke-check sprint`)
- [ ] QA sign-off report: APPROVED or APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS (`/team-qa sprint`)
- [ ] No S1 or S2 bugs in delivered features
- [ ] Design documents updated for any deviations
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
```

For `update`:

**Update an existing sprint plan**:

1. Read the most recent sprint plan from `production/sprints/`.
2. Present the current story list with their current statuses from `production/sprint-status.yaml`.
3. Ask the user what to change: stories to add, remove, reprioritize, or re-estimate. Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather changes.
4. Apply the changes and re-present the full revised plan for review.
5. Re-run the producer feasibility gate (Phase 4) on the revised plan.
6. Auto-write the updated markdown plan and yaml together (same auto-write behavior as `new` mode — no approval gate).

Note: `update` mode does not reset story statuses. Stories already marked `in-progress` or `done` keep their status. Only `backlog` and `ready-for-dev` stories can be removed or reprioritized freely.

For `status`:

**Generate a status report**:

```markdown
# Sprint [N] Status -- [Date]

## Progress: [X/Y tasks complete] ([Z%])

### Completed
| Task | Completed By | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|

### In Progress
| Task | Owner | % Done | Blockers |
|------|-------|--------|----------|

### Not Started
| Task | Owner | At Risk? | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|

### Blocked
| Task | Blocker | Owner of Blocker | ETA |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----|

## Burndown Assessment
[On track / Behind / Ahead]
[If behind: What is being cut or deferred]

## Emerging Risks
- [Any new risks identified this sprint]
```

## Phase 3: Prepare Sprint Status File

After generating a new sprint plan, also prepare the `production/sprint-status.yaml` content.
This is the machine-readable source of truth for story status — read by
`/sprint-status`, `/story-done`, and `/help` without markdown parsing.

**Do not write the yaml yet** — hold it in context. The producer feasibility gate (Phase 4) may revise the story list. Both files will be written together after Phase 4 in a single write approval.

Format:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by /sprint-plan. Updated by /story-done and /dev-story.
# DO NOT edit manually — use /story-done to update story status.
#
# Status value mapping (yaml ↔ story file Status field):
#   backlog        ↔  Not Started
#   ready-for-dev  ↔  Ready
#   in-progress    ↔  In Progress
#   review         ↔  In Review
#   done           ↔  Complete
#   blocked        ↔  Blocked

sprint: [N]
goal: "[sprint goal]"
start: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
end: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
generated: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
updated: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"

stories:
  - id: "[epic-story, e.g. 1-1]"
    name: "[story name]"
    file: "[production/stories/path.md]"
    priority: must-have        # must-have | should-have | nice-to-have
    status: ready-for-dev      # backlog | ready-for-dev | in-progress | review | done | blocked
    owner: ""
    estimate_days: 0
    blocker: ""
    completed: ""
```

Initialize each story from the sprint plan's task tables:
- Must Have tasks → `priority: must-have`, `status: ready-for-dev`
- Should Have tasks → `priority: should-have`, `status: backlog`
- Nice to Have tasks → `priority: nice-to-have`, `status: backlog`

For `update`: read the existing `sprint-status.yaml`, carry over statuses for
stories that haven't changed, add new stories, remove dropped ones.

---

## Phase 4: Producer Feasibility Gate

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning PR-SPRINT:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "PR-SPRINT skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 5 (QA plan gate).
- `lean` → skip (not a PHASE-GATE). Note: "PR-SPRINT skipped — Lean mode." Proceed to Phase 5 (QA plan gate).
- `full` → spawn as normal.

Before finalising the sprint plan, spawn `producer` via Task using gate **PR-SPRINT** (`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`).

Pass: proposed story list (titles, estimates, dependencies), total team capacity in hours/days, any carryover from the previous sprint, milestone constraints and deadline.

Present the producer's assessment.

**If UNREALISTIC** (objective capacity-vs-estimate math — sum(estimates) exceeds
available days): auto-defer the overflow stories from Must Have down to Should
Have / Nice to Have until the Must Have total fits within available days. This is
an objective rebalance — no human pause. Re-present the rebalanced plan and note
which stories were deferred and why. (Replacement check: sum(Must Have estimates)
≤ available days after rebalance.)

**If CONCERNS** (a soft risk-tolerance flag, not a capacity failure): auto-proceed
**with a logged rationale** — do not pause for human approval. Append a
`## Producer Concerns (auto-accepted)` block to the sprint plan recording the
specific concern raised and the rationale for proceeding (e.g., "buffer is tight
but carryover risk is low"). The plan proceeds to the write step.

After handling the producer's verdict, auto-write the sprint plan to
`production/sprints/sprint-[N].md` and `production/sprint-status.yaml` together
(creating directories as needed) — the files are computed from the feasibility-checked
plan, so no approval gate is required. (Replacement check: both files written
atomically; the yaml status mapping matches the plan priorities.) Verdict:
**COMPLETE** — sprint plan and status file created.

After writing, add:

> **Scope check:** If this sprint includes stories added beyond the original epic scope, run `/scope-check [epic]` to detect scope creep before implementation begins.

---

## Phase 5: QA Plan Gate

Before closing the sprint plan, check whether a QA plan exists for this sprint.

Use `Glob` to look for `production/qa/qa-plan-sprint-[N].md` or any file in `production/qa/` referencing this sprint number.

**If a QA plan is found**: note it in the sprint plan output — "QA Plan: `[path]`" — and proceed.

**If no QA plan exists**: do not silently proceed and do not prompt — auto-inject a
warning block into the sprint plan document and surface the next step in the
output. (Replacement check: QA-plan presence is asserted; when absent, the warning
block is auto-injected into the written plan.)

Auto-inject this warning block into the sprint plan document:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **No QA Plan**: This sprint was started without a QA plan. Run `/qa-plan sprint`
> before the last story is implemented. The Production → Polish gate requires a QA
> sign-off report, which requires a QA plan.
```

Then close with: "Sprint plan written. No QA plan found — a warning block was added.
Run `/qa-plan sprint` before implementation begins; the Production → Polish gate
requires a QA sign-off report, which requires a QA plan."

---

## Phase 6: Next Steps

After the sprint plan is written and QA plan status is resolved:

- `/qa-plan sprint` — **required before implementation begins** — defines test cases per story so developers implement against QA specs, not a blank slate
- `/story-readiness [story-file]` — validate a story is ready before starting it
- `/dev-story [story-file]` — begin implementing the first story
- `/sprint-status` — check progress mid-sprint
- `/scope-check [epic]` — verify no scope creep before implementation begins

**Review mode configuration:** All director gates (producer feasibility, QA review, code review) respect the project review mode. The review mode is set in Phase 0 when the file does not exist (for `new` sprints), or can be overridden per-run with `--review full|lean|solo` as an argument. The file `production/review-mode.txt` contains one of:
- `lean` — skip automated director gates (default if file is absent — fastest for solo dev)
- `full` — run all director gates as spawned sub-agents
- `solo` — skip all gates unconditionally (single-developer, no review)

This file is read by `/sprint-plan`, `/story-readiness`, `/story-done`, and other skills at startup.
